"""
EOS plugin repository.

This module implements the base plugin class and a plugin manager.
The former is an abstract class handling the plugin initialization.
The latter is responsible for plugins detection, loading and running.
Each plugin gets access to the Symfony instance and the scanner engine.

The package contains plugins (one per file) inherited from AbstractPlugin.
Each file is inspected to have at least one class inheriting from it and not being abstract itself.
Buggy plugins logged but ignored.
